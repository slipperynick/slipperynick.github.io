# ðŸ‘‹ About Me  

I'm **Nick**, a **Security Engineer**. I specialize in **Kubernetes security, AWS/Azure, macOS & security automation**, helping teams build **resilient, scalable, and secure infrastructures**.  

With experience working in **global security teams**, Iâ€™ve led **cloud security initiatives, automated security processes, and improved compliance across complex environments**. I thrive at the intersection of **engineering and security**, solving complex problems with **automation and strategic thinking**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Supporting Nonprofits** â€“ If you're a **nonprofit in need of security guidance**, I'd love to help. Feel free to reach out!
