# About Me  

I'm **Nick**, a **Security Engineer**. I specialize in **Kubernetes security, AWS/Azure, macOS & security automation**, helping teams build **resilient, scalable, and secure infrastructures**.  

With experience working in **global security teams**, I’ve led **cloud security initiatives, automated security processes, and improved compliance across complex environments**. I thrive at the intersection of **engineering and security**, solving complex problems with **automation and strategic thinking**.  

**Supporting Nonprofits** – If you're a **nonprofit in need of security guidance**, I'd love to help. Feel free to reach out!  

Outside of security, I enjoy **playing basketball, exploring emerging tech, and diving into philosophy**.
