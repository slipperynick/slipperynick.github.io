Living in a 19th-century home means discovering little mysteries in walls, floors, and ceilings. Over the past few months I’ve been sealing gaps and cracks around the house, trying the usual handyman tricks — candles, incense smoke, the “wave your hand slowly and hope you feel something” method. They help, but none of them gave me real confidence.

So I finally picked up a **FLIR One (USB-C)** thermal camera. I wasn’t entirely sure it would work with the iPad, but it did — instantly. Download the app, plug it in, and point it at whatever you’re troubleshooting. Within minutes I found two things:

1. **A warm, happy Bert**

2. **A very cold, very obvious gap in the ceiling** where insulation foam was missing

Honestly? I was amazed at how simple and effective it was. This little tool is now part of the permanent home-repair kit.
