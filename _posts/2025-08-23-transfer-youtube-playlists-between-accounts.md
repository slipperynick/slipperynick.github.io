# How to Transfer YouTube Playlists Between Google Accounts Using Collaboration

When decommissioning my **Google Workspace account**, I needed to migrate my YouTube playlists to a new personal Google account. Unfortunately, YouTube doesn’t provide a direct transfer feature. After some research and trial, I discovered a reliable method using the **Collaborate** feature built into playlists.

Here’s a step-by-step guide with screenshots to follow along.

## 1. Setup

Have two browser windows or tabs open:
- **Old account** → the one you’re retiring (e.g., Workspace account)  
- **New account** → the one you’ll keep  

This makes switching between accounts much easier during the process.

## 2. Create a New Playlist in the New Account

1. Log in with your **new account**.  
2. Click your profile picture (top-right) → **YouTube Studio**.  
3. In the left menu, go to **Content → Playlists**.  
4. Click **Create Playlist**.  
5. Give it the same title as your old playlist (e.g., *Workout*, *Music Long Mixes*).  
6. Set visibility to **Public** (or *Unlisted* if you prefer).  
7. Click **Create**.

## 3. Enable Collaboration

1. In your **new account**, switch back to the channel view (not Studio).  
2. Find and open the new playlist.  
3. Click the **⋮ (three dots)** → **Collaborate**.  
4. Toggle **“Allow collaborators to add videos”**.  
5. Copy the **invite link**.

## 4. Accept Collaboration in the Old Account

1. Switch to the **old account** window.  
2. Paste the invite link in your browser.  
3. Click **Join Playlist** when prompted.

## 5. Copy Videos From Old Playlist

1. In the **old account**, open the **original playlist** you want to transfer.  
2. Click the **⋮ (three dots)** on the playlist page.  
3. Select **Add all to…**.  
4. Choose the **new account’s collaborative playlist** (the one you just created).  
5. All videos from the old playlist will now copy into the new one.

## 6. Finalize and Lock the Playlist

1. Switch back to the **new account**.  
2. Open the playlist and confirm all videos copied correctly.  
3. Return to the **Collaborate** settings.  
4. Turn **collaboration off** to lock the playlist to your ownership.

## ✅ Wrap-Up

Repeat the process for each playlist you want to move (*Workout*, *Music Long Mixes*, *Tech*, *Funny*, etc.). Once everything is in place, you can safely decommission your old Workspace account without losing your playlists.

This collaboration method is currently the simplest, most reliable way to migrate YouTube playlists between accounts without relying on third-party tools.

## Notes

- If you don’t see the **“Add all to…”** option, you may need to manually add videos in batches.  
- Collaboration links work only if the playlist is set to **Public** or **Unlisted**.  
- For very large playlists, give YouTube a moment to populate all videos in the new account.
