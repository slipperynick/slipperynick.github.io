# Playing with LM Arena and NanoBanana

Over the weekend I was experimenting with **LM Arena**, and stumbled across the mysterious **NanoBanana model**.  
Some people online are speculating it might be tied to Google’s new research models—whatever the case, it’s been a lot of fun to play with.

I decided to test it out with a few pictures of my dog and his friends 🐕.  
The results were both **funny** and **surprisingly good**—a mix of realism and playful exaggeration that made me lolz.

Here are a couple of the generations:

It’s exciting to see how quickly these open models are evolving. I’ll definitely keep exploring LM Arena to see what else comes up.
