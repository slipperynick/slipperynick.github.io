I wasn’t planning on attending **Edge Case 2025** this year, but someone from the industry reached out to me on LinkedIn and suggested it might be worth a look. Since it was nearby, I decided to give it a shot — and I’m glad I did.

The event turned out to be fruitful:  
- I met folks from **Chainguard**, a company we’re actively thinking about at work, and got to sit through their presentation on supply chain security.  
- I spoke with people from **Sysdig** and saw **Dell** present on their private cloud/on-prem software.  
- One highlight was a passionate and articulate talk on how **Disney+ was launched**, which stood out as one of the best technical presentations of the day.  

The most valuable part, though, was meeting **True Fullstack** — chatting with Wietse about careers, the industry, and my own next steps toward more people-oriented roles. It reminded me that my skills aren’t just technical; hearing someone push back on my “not a consultant” self-image was a nice boost, and it made me feel alive again.

Overall, Edge Case 2025 was a reminder of the value of showing up, connecting, and listening.
