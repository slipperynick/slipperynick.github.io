After a few years away, I‚Äôve started rebuilding my homelab again ‚Äî this time with a focus on **simplicity, efficiency, and silence**.  
My new foundation is the **MeLE N100 mini PC**, a fanless, ultra-low-power box that‚Äôs been surprisingly capable so far.

## üï∞Ô∏è Looking Back ‚Äî The Previous Homelab

Before this minimal setup, I used to run a larger, more complex lab. It was centered around the following:

- a **UniFi Dream Router** for networking (previously a netgate for pfSense)
- a **NUC8** for virtualization
- a **Synology NAS**.
- a few **LG monitors** (I prefer simplicity these days :D)
- the compute (mac and windows)

That setup included:
- VLAN segmentation between work and home Wi-Fi (so corporate and personal traffic never touched)

Fast-forward about three or four years, moving continents, and a lot of simplification later ‚Äî I‚Äôm starting again, keeping things *as minimal as possible* this time around.

## üñ•Ô∏è The Hardware ‚Äî MeLE N100 Mini PC

![MeLE N100 mini PC on desk](/assets/img/posts/2025-10-08-homelab-part1/homelab1.jpeg)

- Intel N100 CPU (4 cores)  
- 32 GB RAM  
- 512 GB NVMe SSD  
- Completely fanless and whisper-quiet  

Installing **Proxmox VE 9** from a bootable USB was straightforward ‚Äî the BIOS recognized the stick instantly with `F7` at boot.

## üß© Proxmox Running Smoothly

![Proxmox VE dashboard](/assets/img/posts/2025-10-08-homelab-part1/homelab2.jpeg)

Once installed, Proxmox detected all hardware out of the box.  
My first VM is a **Debian 12** instance that serves as my main Linux environment and home for network and security tools.

## üîã Power Efficiency

![Smart-plug power stats showing ‚âà 5 W idle](/assets/img/posts/2025-10-08-homelab-part1/homelab3.jpeg)

The system idles around **5 watts**, roughly the same as a single LED bulb ‚Äî about ‚Ç¨13 per year if left on continuously.  
Exactly what I was aiming for: a quiet, always-on platform that doesn‚Äôt waste energy. I recently put in some solar panels which cost money to send electric back to the grid. Hopefully this offsets that injustice :)

## üîç RunZero Explorer Installed

![RunZero scan results](/assets/img/posts/2025-10-08-homelab-part1/homelab4.jpg)

Inside the Debian VM, I installed **runZero Explorer** to rediscover everything on my LAN.  
Within minutes it identified my Proxmox host, NAS, and other devices ‚Äî a great baseline for inventory and security mapping. I also realized it had been awhile since I used RunZero and it also has vulnerability information which it already helped me realize I need to patch a few of those IoT devices.

## ü§î Next Steps

- Kubernetes cluster testing 
- Continue documenting / diagramming the *Homelab* adventures
