I’ve been meaning to properly document the security and tech resources I rely on.

With my upcoming role requiring me to stay current across a *broader* range of topics — security, cloud, engineering, and industry context — I wanted something more deliberate than scattered bookmarks and feeds.

I’ve now created a **[resources Markdown file in my GitHub](https://github.com/slipperynick/reference/blob/1bb5a732afd581a839adf646f37bb453b0817684/security-resources/security-resources.md)** that captures the things I actively follow:  
podcasts, Discord and Slack communities, and RSS feeds across tech and security.

It’s intentionally simple and text-based — easy to maintain, easy to share, and easy to evolve over time.
